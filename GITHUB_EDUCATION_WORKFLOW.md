# Applying GitHub Education Benefits & Copilot to Your Student Workflow

## 1. **Project Initialization**

- **Create a new repository:**  
  Use free private repos for coursework and personal projects.
  ```bash
  gh repo create my-student-project --private
  ```

- **Set up a README:**  
  Use Copilot to generate a project outline and documentation structure as you start!

## 2. **Coding with GitHub Copilot**

- **Enable Copilot in your IDE (e.g., VS Code):**
  - Go to **Extensions** > **GitHub Copilot**, install and sign in.
  - Use Copilot to speed up code writing, understand new patterns, and create tests.

- **Example usage:**
  - Start typing a function description, Copilot will generate code suggestions.
  - Request troubleshooting help by describing your bug in a comment.

## 3. **Collaboration & Version Control**

- **Branching:**  
  Work in branches to isolate features (`feature/xyz`), using Copilot-generated code as a starting point.
- **Pull Requests:**  
  Create PRs for peer review. Use Copilot to assist with code comments or documentation inside the PR.

## 4. **Leverage Developer Pack Tools**

- **Cloud Deployments:**  
  Deploy your apps for free via offers like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean included in the Student Pack.
- **Learning Platforms:**  
  Access premium resources (Educative, DataCamp) to upskill as needed.

## 5. **Documentation & Sharing**

- **Automated Docs:**  
  Copilot can help generate or suggest docs/comments for your code.
- **Design/UI:**  
  Use Canva or Figma (free via Student Pack) for presentations, diagrams, or UI mockups.

## 6. **Community & Support**

- **Engage in Hackathons:**  
  Apply via GitHub Events—great for real-world practice.
- **Campus Experts program:**  
  Network, learn new skills, and get support from student leaders globally.
